# Governance

## Roles
- Maintainers: responsible for roadmap, releases, and final reviews.
- Contributors: anyone submitting issues, PRs, or docs.
- Triagers (optional): label/triage issues and review docs/tests.

## Decision Making
- Changes land via PR + at least one maintainer approval and passing CI.
- For contentious changes, maintainers seek consensus; lacking that, a simple majority of maintainers decides.

## Releases
- Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
- Changelog follows Keep a Changelog format.
- Trusted publishing (PyPI) via GitHub Actions on tagged releases.

## Code of Conduct
- We follow the Contributor Covenant (see CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Changes to Governance
- Propose via PR; approved by maintainers.
